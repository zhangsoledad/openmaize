  Openmaize is an authentication library for Elixir.

  It provides the following functionality:

  ## Authentication

  * Openmaize.Authenticate - authenticate the user, using JSON Web Tokens.
  * Openmaize.Login - handle login POST requests.
  * Openmaize.Logout - handle logout requests.

  ## Email confirmation and password resetting

  * Openmaize.ConfirmEmail - verify the token that was sent to the user by email.
  * Openmaize.ResetPassword - verify the token that was sent to the user by email,
  but this time so that the user's password can be reset.

  ## Various helper functions

  In the Openmaize.DB module:

  * add_password_hash - take an Ecto changeset, hash the password and add the
  password hash to the changeset.
  * add_confirm_token - add a confirmation token to the changeset.
  * add_reset_token - add a reset token to the changeset.

  See the relevant module documentation for more details.

  For configuration, see the documentation for Openmaize.Config.

  There is an example of Openmaize being used with Phoenix at
  [Openmaize-phoenix](https://github.com/riverrun/openmaize-phoenix).
